## Architect

Architect is a Silksong level editor, used for creating and sharing your own custom maps.

The mod is designed to be simple but powerful, with a ton of different things you can place down with loads of configuration options, including enemies, platforms, levers, gates and even your own custom textures and sounds!

The advanced event system means you can hook any event to any action, ranging from simple levers and doors to fully custom arenas or puzzles!

Architect's in-game level sharer also makes it really easy to share your custom maps with others, without needing to manage sharing the files yourself.
